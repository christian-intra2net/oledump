oledump by Didier Stevens

This is a "fork" of oledump by Dider Stevens as found on https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/ . It is partially contained in the Didier Stevens Suite here on github

I added a setup.py and a little script oledump_all.py

This will not be maintained much longer, want to switch to using oleobj.py from oletools by decalage2.
